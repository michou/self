					<h1>Mocking the real world for fun and profit</h1>
					<p style="text-align: right;">&mdash; Mihai Balan, QE Dev @ Adobe Identity</p>
					<aside class="notes" data-trim data-markdown>
Hi,
I'm Mihai Balan and I'm a QE Developer (or Software Engineer in Test as everybody else seems to be
calling it) in the Identity group here in Adobe. Tonight I want to tell you a couple of real-world
stories about how we used mocking for a lot more than just unit testing. Also, I know it's a big no-no
to mention that before the presentation, but I'm also eager to hear your own stories over pizza and
beer afterwards.

Before we begin proper, a short show of hands<br>
&ndash; is there anyone here that doesn't know what mocking is?<br>
&ndash; is there anyone who **never** _used_ mocking when testing a product / service?

					<blockquote class="wikipedia-mocking fragment">
						In <strong class="fragment highlight-blue">object-oriented programming</strong>, mock objects are simulated objects that <span class="fragment highlight-blue">mimic the behavior of real objects in controlled ways</span>.

					<aside class="notes" data-trim data-markdown>
As far as definitions go, let's see what Wikipedia has to say about mocking, since we all know that Wikipedia is the source of truth. _(click)_

Now, that definition is restrictive enough (it's OOP only, programmer-only, car-crushing-impact-only)

But if you think about it, we use "almost-but-not-quite-real" objects all the time when testing &ndash;
be it mock test data, that barely passes the validations, mock credit card numbers, dummy test files
and so on.

					<aside class="notes" data-trim data-markdown>
With the next 3 stories, I'm going to try and convince you (in case I already didn't), that mocking
can be used in a lot of places and that doing so is really worth it &ndash; both for your products'
qulity and, sometimes, for your own self-esteem as well.

I gave each of my stories a title...

						</p>
						<aside class="notes" data-trim data-markdown>
The Wikipedia definition, 2 slides ago, explicitly mentions Object-oriented programming. That's because
OOP and polymorphism make it easy to swap components that share a common interface without changes to
the underlying code &ndash; and that makes mocking easy.

In addition, Dependency Injection frameworks, that are routinely used with OOP languages go a step
further by decoupling resource usage and creation and allowing live hotswapping.

						<aside class="notes" data-trim data-markdown>
Since it was rather self-contained, we wanted to try something new, namely Integration in the small.

Integration in the small (some might know it as functional testing) tests multiple components in concert.
It's somewhere in between unit-tests and full-blown integration testing. In our case, that meant that the
network was not involved, and we didn't boot up the app server.

Also, Spring allows for the kind of partial bootstrapping used in these tests, so it was nice that
we had some support out of the box.

						<p class="fragment">Enjoy TestNG ü•Ç</p>
						<aside class="notes" data-trim data-markdown>
How we went about implementing this was that we mocked the things that weren't the object of the test
by using Mockito. This is a mocking library that basically allows to create a mock out of any object;
by default the mocks have the same interface as the mocked object but all methods are NOPs.

For the things that we actually wanted to test, we implemented shallow mocks ourselves, and let Spring
inject them in all the proper places.

Further down the line, MockMVC (which is part of Spring) allows you to call methods in your service 
as if they came over the wire, only that you're actually calling Java methods. It also allows you to
inspect the response, all neatly packed as Java objects.

And in the end, it's business as usual, with TestNG.

In our case we have the declaration of our Redis client in the service under test, but somewhere down
the line we implement our shallow mock that is basically just a map. Spring takes care of injecting the

The extra effort was definitely worth it:

						<aside class="notes" data-trim data-markown>
One of the features we just released is the ability to use your facebook / Google account to log in
to our service. In terms of how we implemented this, we first added support for facebook, which was
awesome, as they have a lot of support (APIs) for testing.

OTOH their APIs are very slow, flaky and come with some rather draconian rate limits (i.e. no parallel
calls, no more than 2000 users). So we had to have a lot of double checks and retries in place to make
sure we actually get what we asked.

And then we were told we had to add Google in the mix as well. And fast.

						<h2>ü§™ Can we test Google?</h2>
						<p class="fragment">No way to create test accounts<br>

						</p>
						<aside class="notes" data-trim data-markown>
So we naturally asked ourselves, how do we test for Google?

Because you can't create test accounts - definitely not programatically, and even manually you had to
have a phone number for each account. Automating the log in steps, even when you had the accounts wasn't
easy either, especially when done from within AWS' datacenters, since Google would require phone verification.

And because we run the tests on CI, we needed fresh new accounts for each test run. So yeah, not a pretty picture.

						<p class="fragment">Reverse engineer the UI <span class="fragment">ü§î</span></p>
						<p class="fragment">Configurable Google endpoints</p>
						<aside class="notes" data-trim data-markown>
This was basically a rather simple and plain web service built with python and deployed in the cloud
using Elastic BeanStalk.

Our service was using Google's OAuth APIs, so based on the standard and the public documentation we
reverse engineered the subset of APIs we were using.

Not yet losing hope, we decided it would be nice to have the UI behave the same way as Google, just in
case we find a way to automate at least some flows with real Google accounts.

In the end, we had to do some tweaking to the actual product code to allow using both Google and our
mock side by side, but it was basically just wiring property files and Spring properties

						<h2>ü§™ Was it worth it?</h2>
						<p class="fragment">We were able to test!</p>
						<p class="fragment">Easier debugging while developing the feature</p>
						<p class="fragment">Decreased test run times</p>
						<p class="fragment">Fun! üêç</p>
						<aside class="notes" data-trim data-markown>
First and foremost this was important because it allowed us to test our Google integration.

On top of that, having a mock that we controlled allowed us to easily reproduce edge cases and it helped
developers as well.

Also, since the mock was really dirt simple, it was also very fast, so the same test suite, when run with
the Google mock, would be 40-50% faster than the suite run with Facebook.

Not last, for me it was fun and very instructive, as I learned a lot about deploying a service on the Internet.

						<aside class="notes" data-trim data-markown>
Our third story happened a couple of years ago, when we added the ability to reset your password by
typing in a code received over text vs. a link in your inbox.

We were using an external service provider, that had a staging environment as well - which we used during
feature development.

However, we knew that at one point we had to do some performance testing of the system as a whole and
we were thinking about how to keep the costs down.

						<p class="fragment">Don&rsquo;t break the bank<br>
							<span class="left-pad fragment">&ndash; if at all possible</span></p>
						<aside class="notes" data-trim data-markown>
From past as well as first-hand experiences, we knew that there were some gotchas about this kind of load
tests.

First of all, the staging environment we were using was not fast and stable enough to handle the kind
of load we wanted to simulate.

NOP-ing the calls in the server would produce very skewed data, and we wanted to see exactly how all
the network nitty-gritty influenced our performance when calling a third-party service.

Last but not least, we wanted to keep costs low. In another occasion, during a load test for a system
that incidentally was also sending email, we ended up with a bill that could purchase a small family
car - and we wanted to avoid that.

						<p class="fragment">ü§ñ + ü§ñ = üí™</p>
						<aside class="notes" data-trim data-markown>
As such, a mock was born.

It was written in Java, Spring and not much else.

We needed it to be available over the internet, to match as closely as possible the final configuration,
so we deployed it in AWS. It was exposing the same APIs as the SMS provider, but they just NOP-ed and
returned success.

On the product side there was no extra effort needed, since we already had this configurable, since we
were using the staging environment for development.

So we started the load test, the throughput was ramping up nicely, but then it stopped well before we
reached the desired load. People scrambled trying to understand where the bottle neck was; it turns out
that the mock had reached its capacity. We raised more machines, put them behind a load balancer and then
the test continued smoothly.

						<aside class="notes" data-trim data-markown>
First of all, this saved us a lot of money we didn't give to the SMS provider for sending texts out in the void.

The whole ordeal also taught us a thing or two about DevOps and networking and scaling.

Most importantly however, it sparked a Let's do it attitude and paved the way for other mocks, including
the Google mock I talked about earlier

					<aside class="notes" data-trim data-markown>
Mocking is not just for unit tests - you can use it for integration testing, performance testing, even security testing, you can use it for fault injection as well.

It doesn't come free though - but you should see the cost as an investment in the general testability of the product.

Also, use what already exists, but if you don't find a good wheel, roll your own.
